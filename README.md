Hi, I am Armagidon 👋. I am on open-source developer and a *technical artist* 🎨, so don't critize me for my shitty code, anyone can offend the artist. Pff 🙎.

Previously I was and active Minecraft plugin developer, but now I can make your dream come true, *fo de MO-NE*

I am best known for:
- PosePlugin 🤸 
- MLDokio 📀 (That's kind of a lie)
- eeeerhm, that's it pretty much. Meh. 😒

Currently I am learning *C* programming language and developing some strange shit with it.
