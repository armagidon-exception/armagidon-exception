Hi, I am Armagidon ðŸ‘‹. I am on open-source developer and a *technical artist* ðŸŽ¨, so don't critize me for my shitty code, anyone can offend the artist. Pff ðŸ™Ž.

Previously I was and active Minecraft plugin developer, but now I can make your dream come true, *fo de MO-NE*

I am best known for:
- PosePlugin ðŸ¤¸ 
- MLDokio ðŸ“€ (That's kind of a lie)
- eeeerhm, that's it pretty much. Meh. ðŸ˜’

Currently I am learning *C* programming language and developing some strange shit with it.
